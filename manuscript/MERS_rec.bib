	Abstract = {The {SD}0 mutant of influenza virus A/{WSN}/33 ({WSN}), characterized by a 24-amino-acid deletion in the neuraminidase ({NA}) stalk, does not grow in embryonated chicken eggs because of defective {NA} function. Continuous passage of {SD}0 in eggs yielded 10 independent clones that replicated efficiently. Characterization of these egg-adapted viruses showed that five of the viruses contained insertions in the {NA} gene from the {PB}1, {PB}2, or {NP} gene, in the region linking the transmembrane and catalytic head domains, demonstrating that recombination of influenza viral {RNA} segments occurs relatively frequently. The other five viruses did not contain insertions in this region but displayed decreased binding affinity toward sialylglycoconjugates, compared with the binding properties of the parental virus. Sequence analysis of one of the latter viruses revealed mutations in the hemagglutinin ({HA}) gene, at sites in close proximity to the sialic acid receptor-binding pocket. These mutations appear to compensate for reduced {NA} function due to stalk deletions. Thus, balanced {HA}-{NA} functions are necessary for efficient influenza virus replication.},

	Abstract = {To determine the extent of homologous recombination in human influenza A virus, we assembled a data set of 13,852 sequences representing all eight segments and both major circulating subtypes, H3N2 and H1N1. Using an exhaustive search and a nonparametric test for mosaic structure, we identified 315 sequences (∼2\%) in five different {RNA} segments that, after a multiple-comparison correction, had statistically significant mosaic signals compatible with homologous recombination. Of these, only two contained recombinant regions of sufficient length ({\textgreater}100 nucleotides [nt]) that the occurrence of homologous recombination could be verified using phylogenetic methods, with the rest involving very short sequence regions (15 to 30 nt). Although this secondary analysis revealed patterns of phylogenetic incongruence compatible with the action of recombination, neither candidate recombinant was strongly supported. Given our inability to exclude the occurrence of mixed infection and template switching during amplification, laboratory artifacts provide an alternative and likely explanation for the occurrence of phylogenetic incongruence in these two cases. We therefore conclude that, if it occurs at all, homologous recombination plays only a very minor role in the evolution of human influenza A virus.},

	Abstract = {The segmented {RNA} genome of avian Influenza viruses ({AIV}) allows genetic reassortment between co-infecting viruses, providing an evolutionary pathway to generate genetic innovation. The genetic diversity (16 haemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase subtypes) of {AIV} indicates an extensive reservoir of influenza viruses exists in bird populations, but how frequently subtypes reassort with each other is still unknown. Here we quantify the reassortment patterns among subtypes in the Eurasian avian viral pool by reconstructing the ancestral states of the subtypes as discrete states on time-scaled phylogenies with respect to the internal protein coding segments. We further analyzed how host species, the inferred evolutionary rates and the {dN}/{dS} ratio varied among segments and between discrete subtypes, and whether these factors may be associated with inter-subtype reassortment rate.

	Abstract = {H9N2 influenza A viruses have become established worldwide in terrestrial poultry and wild birds, and are occasionally transmitted to mammals including humans and pigs. To comprehensively elucidate the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of H9N2 influenza viruses, we performed a large-scale sequence analysis of 571 viral genomes from the {NCBI} Influenza Virus Resource Database, representing the spectrum of H9N2 influenza viruses isolated from 1966 to 2009. Our study provides a panoramic framework for better understanding the genesis and evolution of H9N2 influenza viruses, and for describing the history of H9N2 viruses circulating in diverse hosts. Panorama phylogenetic analysis of the eight viral gene segments revealed the complexity and diversity of H9N2 influenza viruses. The 571 H9N2 viral genomes were classified into 74 separate lineages, which had marked host and geographical differences in phylogeny. Panorama genotypical analysis also revealed that H9N2 viruses include at least 98 genotypes, which were further divided according to their {HA} lineages into seven series (A--G). Phylogenetic analysis of the internal genes showed that H9N2 viruses are closely related to H3, H4, H5, H7, H10, and H14 subtype influenza viruses. Our results indicate that H9N2 viruses have undergone extensive reassortments to generate multiple reassortants and genotypes, suggesting that the continued circulation of multiple genotypical H9N2 viruses throughout the world in diverse hosts has the potential to cause future influenza outbreaks in poultry and epidemics in humans. We propose a nomenclature system for identifying and unifying all lineages and genotypes of H9N2 influenza viruses in order to facilitate international communication on the evolution, ecology and epidemiology of H9N2 influenza viruses.},

	Abstract = {A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, H5N1, caused disease outbreaks in poultry in China and seven other east Asian countries between late 2003 and early 2004; the same virus was fatal to humans in Thailand and Vietnam. Here we demonstrate a series of genetic reassortment events traceable to the precursor of the H5N1 viruses that caused the initial human outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 (refs 2--4) and subsequent avian outbreaks in 2001 and 2002 (refs 5, 6). These events gave rise to a dominant H5N1 genotype (Z) in chickens and ducks that was responsible for the regional outbreak in 2003--04. Our findings indicate that domestic ducks in southern China had a central role in the generation and maintenance of this virus, and that wild birds may have contributed to the increasingly wide spread of the virus in Asia. Our results suggest that H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential have become endemic in the region and are not easily eradicable. These developments pose a threat to public and veterinary health in the region and potentially the world, and suggest that long-term control measures are required.},

@article{robertson_aids_1995,
	Abstract = {Recombination contributes to the generation of genetic diversity in human immunodeficiency viruses ({HIV}) but can only occur between viruses replicating within the same cell. Since individuals have not been found to be simultaneously coinfected with multiple divergent strains of {HIV}-1 or {HIV}-2, recombination events have been thought to be restricted to the rather closely related members of the quasispecies that evolves during the course of {HIV} infection. Here we describe examples of both {HIV}-1 and {HIV}-2 genomes that appear to be hybrids of genetically quite divergent viruses. Phylogenetic analyses were used to examine the evolutionary relationships among multiple {HIV} strains. Evolutionary trees derived from different genomic regions were consistent with respect to most of the viruses investigated. However, some strains of {HIV}-1 and {HIV}-2 exhibited significantly discordant branching orders indicative of genetic exchanges during their evolutionary histories. The crossover points of these putative recombination events were mapped by examining the distribution of phylogenetically informative sites supporting alternative tree topologies. A similar example of a recombinant simian immunodeficiency virus identified in West African green monkeys has also been described recently. These results indicate that coinfection with highly divergent viral strains can occur in {HIV}-infected humans and {SIV}-infected primates and could lead to the generation of hybrid genomes with significantly altered biological properties. Thus, future characterization of primate lentiviruses should include careful phylogenetic investigation of possible genomic mosaicism.},

	Abstract = {Phylogenetic studies based on {DNA} sequences typically ignore the potential occurrence of recombination, which may produce different alignment regions with different evolutionary histories. Traditional phylogenetic methods assume that a single history underlies the data. If recombination is present, can we expect the inferred phylogeny to represent any of the underlying evolutionary histories? We examined this question by applying traditional phylogenetic reconstruction methods to simulated recombinant sequence alignments. The effect of recombination on phylogeny estimation depended on the relatedness of the sequences involved in the recombinational event and on the extent of the different regions with different phylogenetic histories. Given the topologies examined here, when the recombinational event was ancient, or when recombination occurred between closely related taxa, one of the two phylogenies underlying the data was generally inferred. In this scenario, the evolutionary history corresponding to the majority of the positions in the alignment was generally recovered. Very different results were obtained when recombination occurred recently among divergent taxa. In this case, when the recombinational breakpoint divided the alignment in two regions of similar length, a phylogeny that was different from any of the true phylogenies underlying the data was inferred.},

@article{schierup_2000,
	Abstract = {We investigate the shape of a phylogenetic tree reconstructed from sequences evolving under the coalescent with recombination. The motivation is that evolutionary inferences are often made from phylogenetic trees reconstructed from population data even though recombination may well occur ({mtDNA} or viral sequences) or does occur (nuclear sequences). We investigate the size and direction of biases when a single tree is reconstructed ignoring recombination. Standard software ({PHYLIP}) was used to construct the best phylogenetic tree from sequences simulated under the coalescent with recombination. With recombination present, the length of terminal branches and the total branch length are larger, and the time to the most recent common ancestor smaller, than for a tree reconstructed from sequences evolving with no recombination. The effects are pronounced even for small levels of recombination that may not be immediately detectable in a data set. The phylogenies when recombination is present superficially resemble phylogenies for sequences from an exponentially growing population. However, exponential growth has a different effect on statistics such as Tajima's D. Furthermore, ignoring recombination leads to a large overestimation of the substitution rate heterogeneity and the loss of the molecular clock. These results are discussed in relation to viral and {mtDNA} data sets.},

@article{anisimova_2003,
	Abstract = {Maximum-likelihood methods based on models of codon substitution accounting for heterogeneous selective pressures across sites have proved to be powerful in detecting positive selection in protein-coding {DNA} sequences. Those methods are phylogeny based and do not account for the effects of recombination. When recombination occurs, such as in population data, no unique tree topology can describe the evolutionary history of the whole sequence. This violation of assumptions raises serious concerns about the likelihood method for detecting positive selection. Here we use computer simulation to evaluate the reliability of the likelihood-ratio test ({LRT}) for positive selection in the presence of recombination. We examine three tests based on different models of variable selective pressures among sites. Sequences are simulated using a coalescent model with recombination and analyzed using codon-based likelihood models ignoring recombination. We find that the {LRT} is robust to low levels of recombination (with fewer than three recombination events in the history of a sample of 10 sequences). However, at higher levels of recombination, the type I error rate can be as high as 90\%, especially when the null model in the {LRT} is unrealistic, and the test often mistakes recombination as evidence for positive selection. The test that compares the more realistic models M7 (β) against M8 (β and ω) is more robust to recombination, where the null model M7 allows the positive selection pressure to vary between 0 and 1 (and so does not account for positive selection), and the alternative model M8 allows an additional discrete class with ω= {dN}/{dS} that could be estimated to be {\textgreater}1 (and thus accounts for positive selection). Identification of sites under positive selection by the empirical Bayes method appears to be less affected than the {LRT} by recombination.},

Middle East respiratory syndrome ({MERS}) is a new human disease caused by a novel coronavirus ({CoV}). Clinical data on {MERS}-{CoV} infections are scarce. We report epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of 47 cases of {MERS}-{CoV} infections, identify knowledge gaps, and define research priorities.
Methods
We abstracted and analysed epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from confirmed cases of sporadic, household, community, and health-care-associated {MERS}-{CoV} infections reported from Saudi Arabia between Sept 1, 2012, and June 15, 2013. Cases were confirmed as having {MERS}-{CoV} by real-time {RT}-{PCR}.
Findings
47 individuals (46 adults, one child) with laboratory-confirmed {MERS}-{CoV} disease were identified; 36 (77\%) were male (male:female ratio 3·3:1). 28 patients died, a 60\% case-fatality rate. The case-fatality rate rose with increasing age. Only two of the 47 cases were previously healthy; most patients (45 [96\%]) had underlying comorbid medical disorders, including diabetes (32 [68\%]), hypertension (16 [34\%]), chronic cardiac disease (13 [28\%]), and chronic renal disease (23 [49\%]). Common symptoms at presentation were fever (46 [98\%]), fever with chills or rigors (41 [87\%]), cough (39 [83\%]), shortness of breath (34 [72\%]), and myalgia (15 [32\%]). Gastrointestinal symptoms were also frequent, including diarrhoea (12 [26\%]), vomiting (ten [21\%]), and abdominal pain (eight [17\%]). All patients had abnormal findings on chest radiography, ranging from subtle to extensive unilateral and bilateral abnormalities. Laboratory analyses showed raised concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (23 [49\%]) and aspartate aminotransferase (seven [15\%]) and thrombocytopenia (17 [36\%]) and lymphopenia (16 [34\%]).
Interpretation
Disease caused by {MERS}-{CoV} presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations and is associated with substantial mortality in admitted patients who have medical comorbidities. Major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, community prevalence, and clinical spectrum of infection and disease need urgent definition.

	Abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
The novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) had, as of Aug 8, 2013, caused 111 virologically confirmed or probable human cases of infection worldwide. We analysed epidemiological and genetic data to assess the extent of human infection, the performance of case detection, and the transmission potential of {MERS}-{CoV} with and without control measures.
Methods
We assembled a comprehensive database of all confirmed and probable cases from public sources and estimated the incubation period and generation time from case cluster data. Using data of numbers of visitors to the Middle East and their duration of stay, we estimated the number of symptomatic cases in the Middle East. We did independent analyses, looking at the growth in incident clusters, the growth in viral population, the reproduction number of cluster index cases, and cluster sizes to characterise the dynamical properties of the epidemic and the transmission scenario.
Findings
The estimated number of symptomatic cases up to Aug 8, 2013, is 940 (95\% {CI} 290--2200), indicating that at least 62\% of human symptomatic cases have not been detected. We find that the case-fatality ratio of primary cases detected via routine surveillance (74\%; 95\% {CI} 49--91) is biased upwards because of detection bias; the case-fatality ratio of secondary cases was 20\% (7--42). Detection of milder cases (or clinical management) seemed to have improved in recent months. Analysis of human clusters indicated that chains of transmission were not self-sustaining when infection control was implemented, but that R in the absence of controls was in the range 0·8--1·3. Three independent data sources provide evidence that R cannot be much above 1, with an upper bound of 1·2--1·5.
Interpretation
By showing that a slowly growing epidemic is underway either in human beings or in an animal reservoir, quantification of uncertainty in transmissibility estimates, and provision of the first estimates of the scale of the epidemic and extent of case detection biases, we provide valuable information for more informed risk assessment.

	Abstract = {In its largest outbreak, Ebola virus disease is spreading through Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. We sequenced 99 Ebola virus genomes from 78 patients in Sierra Leone to {\textasciitilde}2000× coverage. We observed a rapid accumulation of interhost and intrahost genetic variation, allowing us to characterize patterns of viral transmission over the initial weeks of the epidemic. This West African variant likely diverged from central African lineages around 2004, crossed from Guinea to Sierra Leone in May 2014, and has exhibited sustained human-to-human transmission subsequently, with no evidence of additional zoonotic sources. Because many of the mutations alter protein sequences and other biologically meaningful targets, they should be monitored for impact on diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies critical to outbreak response.
Evolution of Ebola virus over time
The high rate of mortality in the current Ebola epidemic has made it difficult for researchers to collect samples of the virus and study its evolution. Gire et al. describe Ebola epidemiology on the basis of 99 whole-genome sequences, including samples from 78 affected individuals. The authors analyzed changes in the viral sequence and conclude that the current outbreak probably resulted from the spread of the virus from central Africa in the past decade. The outbreak started from a single transmission event from an unknown animal reservoir into the human population. Two viral lineages from Guinea then spread from person to person into Sierra Leone.

	Abstract = {Here, we present an analysis of the H1N1pdm genetic data sampled over the initial stages in the epidemic. To infer phylodynamic spread in time and space we employ a recently developed Bayesian statistical inference framework (Lemey et al., in press). We model spatial diffusion as a continuous-time Markov chain process along time-measured genealogies. In this analysis, we consider 40 locations for which sequence data were available on 06-Aug-2009. The sampling time interval of the 242 sequences spans from 30-Mar-2009 to 12-Jul-2009. The Bayesian inference typically results in a posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees, each having an estimate of the epidemic locations at the ancestral nodes in the tree. We summarize these trees using the most representative clustering pattern and annotate these clusters with the most probable location states. We can visualize this information as tree that grows over time, seeding locations each time an ancestral node is inferred to exist at a different location. A Bayes factor test provides statistical support for epidemiological linkage throughout the evolutionary history. We demonstrate how our full probabilistic approach efficiently tracks an epidemic based on viral genetic data as it unfolds across the globe.},

	Abstract = {In March and early April 2009, a new swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-{OIV}) emerged in Mexico and the United States. During the first few weeks of surveillance, the virus spread worldwide to 30 countries (as of May 11) by human-to-human transmission, causing the World Health Organization to raise its pandemic alert to level 5 of 6. This virus has the potential to develop into the first influenza pandemic of the twenty-first century. Here we use evolutionary analysis to estimate the timescale of the origins and the early development of the S-{OIV} epidemic. We show that it was derived from several viruses circulating in swine, and that the initial transmission to humans occurred several months before recognition of the outbreak. A phylogenetic estimate of the gaps in genetic surveillance indicates a long period of unsampled ancestry before the S-{OIV} outbreak, suggesting that the reassortment of swine lineages may have occurred years before emergence in humans, and that the multiple genetic ancestry of S-{OIV} is not indicative of an artificial origin. Furthermore, the unsampled history of the epidemic means that the nature and location of the genetically closest swine viruses reveal little about the immediate origin of the epidemic, despite the fact that we included a panel of closely related and previously unpublished swine influenza isolates. Our results highlight the need for systematic surveillance of influenza in swine, and provide evidence that the mixing of new genetic elements in swine can result in the emergence of viruses with pandemic potential in humans.},

	Abstract = {The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) was first documented in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ({KSA}) in 2012 and, to date, has been identified in 180 cases with 43\% mortality. In this study, we have determined the {MERS}-{CoV} evolutionary rate, documented genetic variants of the virus and their distribution throughout the Arabian peninsula, and identified the genome positions under positive selection, important features for monitoring adaptation of {MERS}-{CoV} to human transmission and for identifying the source of infections. Respiratory samples from confirmed {KSA} {MERS} cases from May to September 2013 were subjected to whole-genome deep sequencing, and 32 complete or partial sequences (20 were ≥99\% complete, 7 were 50 to 94\% complete, and 5 were 27 to 50\% complete) were obtained, bringing the total available {MERS}-{CoV} genomic sequences to 65. An evolutionary rate of 1.12 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year (95\% credible interval [95\% {CI}], 8.76 × 10−4; 1.37 × 10−3) was estimated, bringing the time to most recent common ancestor to March 2012 (95\% {CI}, December 2011; June 2012). Only one {MERS}-{CoV} codon, spike 1020, located in a domain required for cell entry, is under strong positive selection. Four {KSA} {MERS}-{CoV} phylogenetic clades were found, with 3 clades apparently no longer contributing to current cases. The size of the population infected with {MERS}-{CoV} showed a gradual increase to June 2013, followed by a decline, possibly due to increased surveillance and infection control measures combined with a basic reproduction number (R0) for the virus that is less than 1.
{IMPORTANCE} {MERS}-{CoV} adaptation toward higher rates of sustained human-to-human transmission appears not to have occurred yet. While {MERS}-{CoV} transmission currently appears weak, careful monitoring of changes in {MERS}-{CoV} genomes and of the {MERS} epidemic should be maintained. The observation of phylogenetically related {MERS}-{CoV} in geographically diverse locations must be taken into account in efforts to identify the animal source and transmission of the virus.},

	Abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) is an emerging virus involved in cases and case clusters of severe acute respiratory infection in the Arabian Peninsula, Tunisia, Morocco, France, Italy, Germany, and the {UK}. We provide a full description of a fatal case of {MERS}-{CoV} infection and associated phylogenetic analyses.
Methods
We report data for a patient who was admitted to the Klinikum Schwabing (Munich, Germany) for severe acute respiratory infection. We did diagnostic {RT}-{PCR} and indirect immunofluorescence. From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantification. We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the five available complete {MERS}-{CoV} genomes.
Findings
A 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness. He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment. The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock. {MERS}-{CoV} was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fluid. Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1·2 × 106 copies per {mL}). Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 {RNA} copies per {mL} on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 {RNA} copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay). One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral {RNA} (5370 copies per {mL}). No virus was detected in blood. The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation. The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
Interpretation
We have provided the first complete viral load profile in a case of {MERS}-{CoV} infection. {MERS}-{CoV} might have shedding patterns that are different from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.

	Abstract = {Canine parvovirus ({CPV}) and feline panleukopenia virus ({FPV}) are over 98\% similar in {DNA} sequence but have specific host range, antigenic, and hemagglutination ({HA}) properties which were located within the capsid protein gene. In vitro mutagenesis and recombination were used to prepare 16 different recombinant genomic clones, and viruses derived from those clones were analyzed for their in vitro host range, antigenic, and {HA} properties. The region of {CPV} from 59 to 91 map units determined the ability to replicate in canine cells. A complex series of interactions was observed among the individual sequence differences between 59 and 73 map units. The canine host range required that {VP}2 amino acids (aa) 93 and 323 both be the {CPV} sequence, and those two {CPV} sequences introduced alone into {FPV} greatly increased viral replication in canine cells. Changing any one of aa 93, 103, or 323 of {CPV} to the {FPV} sequence either greatly decreased replication in canine cells or resulted in an inviable plasmid. The Asn-Lys difference of aa 93 alone was responsible for the {CPV}-specific epitope recognized by monoclonal antibodies. An {FPV}-specific epitope was affected by aa 323. Amino acids 323 and 375 together determined the {pH} dependence of {HA}. Amino acids involved in the various specific properties were all around the threefold spikes of the viral particle.},

	Abstract = {The single gene reassortant virus that derives its {PB}2 gene from the avian influenza A/Mallard/{NY}/78 virus and remaining genes from the human influenza A/Los Angeles/2/87 virus exhibits a host range restriction (hr) phenotype characterized by efficient replication in avian tissue and failure to produce plaques in mammalian Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The hr phenotype is associated with restriction of viral replication in the respiratory tract of squirrel monkeys and humans. To identify the genetic basis of the hr phenotype, we isolated four phenotypic hr mutant viruses that acquired the ability to replicate efficiently in mammalian tissue. Segregational analysis indicated that the loss of the hr phenotype was due to a mutation in the {PB}2 gene itself. The nucleotide sequences of the {PB}2 gene of each of the four hr mutants revealed that a single amino acid substitution at position 627 (Glu--{\textgreater}Lys) was responsible for the restoration of the ability of the {PB}2 single gene reassortant to replicate in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Interestingly, the amino acid at position 627 in every avian influenza A virus {PB}2 protein analyzed to date is glutamic acid, and in every human influenza A virus {PB}2 protein, it is lysine. Thus, the amino acid at residue 627 of {PB}2 is an important determinant of host range of influenza A viruses.},

All 3TC-resistant viruses possess a substitution at the second codon (from a methionine into an isoleucine) at position 184 within the highly conserved motif ({YMDD}) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase. 3TC-resistant viruses were cross-resistant to the (-) enantiomer of the fluorinated derivative of {BCH}-189 but remained susceptible to 2',3'-dideoxyinosine and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine. The susceptibilities of the 3TC-resistant viruses to the (+) enantiomers of {BCH}-189 and the fluorinated derivative of {BCH}-189 demonstrate an enantiomeric specificity for viruses selected under these conditions. Introduction of an isoleucine substitution at codon 184 into a background of two known 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine resistance mutations (amino acids 41 and 215) restored the susceptibility of this virus to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine.},

	Abstract = {Resistant variants of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ({HIV}-1) have been selected by limited passage in {MT}4 cells of both wild-type and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine ({AZT}, zidovudine)-resistant strains with the nucleoside analogues (-)-2'-deoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC) and (-)-2'-deoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine ({FTC}). Virus variants selected independently were crossresistant to both inhibitors. This rapid in vitro selection of resistant virus has not previously been seen with nucleoside analogues but is reminiscent of that observed with the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. However, passage of wild-type virus with a combination of {AZT} and {FTC} appreciably delayed emergence of {FTC}-resistant virus. {DNA} sequence analysis of the reverse transcriptase coding region from {FTC}-resistant virus revealed changes at codon 184 in the highly conserved Tyr, Met, Asp, Asp ({YMDD}) region. When the mutation Met184--{\textgreater}Val was introduced into the infectious clone {HXB}2, this change alone accounted for the resistance ({\textgreater} 1000-fold) seen with both 3TC and {FTC}, and for a 5- to 15-fold reduction in sensitivity to their (+) enantiomers. It had no effect on susceptibility to {AZT} or nevirapine and minimal effect on susceptibility to 2',3'-dideoxyinosine and 2',3'-dideoxycytidine. To determine the influence of this mutation in a background of mutations conferring resistance to {AZT} and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, a series of {HIV}-1 variants were created by site-directed mutagenesis. All mutants with Met184--{\textgreater}Val were cross-resistant to 3TC and {FTC}. The Met184--{\textgreater}Val mutation did not influence nevirapine resistance, but resistance to {AZT} was suppressed. Similar suppression of {AZT} resistance was seen with Tyr181--{\textgreater}Cys. Interestingly, when both Met184--{\textgreater}Val and Tyr181--{\textgreater}Cys substitutions were present, highly resistant virus reverted to complete {AZT} sensitivity. Assessment of the interactive effects of multiple drug-resistance mutations may help to establish a rationale for using these drugs in the future therapy of {HIV} disease.},

	Abstract = {Volunteers experimentally infected with influenza A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1) virus and treated with the neuraminidase ({NA}) inhibitor oseltamivir were monitored for the emergence of drugresistant variants. Two (4\%) of 54 resistant viruses were detected by {NA} inhibition assay among last-day isolates recovered from 54 drug recipients. They bore a substitution His274Tyr in the {NA}. Hemagglutinin ({HA}) variants detected in the placebo group differed from the eggadapted inoculum virus by virtue of amino acid substitutions at residues 137, 225, or both. These variants had a higher affinity for Neu5Ac(α2--6)Gal-containing receptors, which are characteristic of human respiratory epithelium, than for Neu5Ac(α2--3)Gal-containing receptors, which are typical of chicken egg allantoic membrane. Although appearing to be more sensitive to oseltamivir in humans, the variants with increased affinity for Neu5Ac(α2--6)Gal receptors were less sensitive than the Neu5Ac(α2--3)Gal-binding variants in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Thus, {HA} affinity for receptors is an essential feature of influenza virus susceptibility to {NA} inhibitors, both in cell culture and in humans.},

To infer past population dynamics from molecular sequence data, coalescent-based models have been developed for Bayesian nonparametric estimation of effective population size over time. Among the most successful is a Gaussian Markov random field ({GMRF}) model for a single gene locus. Here, we present a generalization of the {GMRF} model that allows for the analysis of multilocus sequence data. Using simulated data, we demonstrate the improved performance of our method to recover true population trajectories and the time to the most recent common ancestor ({TMRCA}). We analyze a multilocus alignment of {HIV}-1 {CRF}02\_AG gene sequences sampled from Cameroon. Our results are consistent with {HIV} prevalence data and uncover some aspects of the population history that go undetected in Bayesian parametric estimation. Finally, we recover an older and more reconcilable {TMRCA} for a classic ancient {DNA} data set.},

	Abstract = {The authors consider Bayesian analysis for continuous-time Markov chain models based on a conditional reference prior. For such models, inference of the elapsed time between chain observations depends heavily on the rate of decay of the prior as the elapsed time increases. Moreover, improper priors on the elapsed time may lead to improper posterior distributions. In addition, an infinitesimal rate matrix also characterizes this class of models. Experts often have good prior knowledge about the parameters of this matrix. The authors show that the use of a proper prior for the rate matrix parameters together with the conditional reference prior for the elapsed time yields a proper posterior distribution. The authors also demonstrate that, when compared to analyses based on priors previously proposed in the literature, a Bayesian analysis on the elapsed time based on the conditional reference prior possesses better frequentist properties. The type of prior thus represents a better default prior choice for estimation software.},

	Abstract = {Recombination is increasingly seen as an important means of shaping genetic diversity in {RNA} viruses. However, observed recombination frequencies vary widely among those viruses studied to date, with only sporadic occurrences reported in {RNA} viruses with negative-sense genomes. To determine the extent of homologous recombination in negative-sense {RNA} viruses, phylogenetic analyses of 79 gene sequence alignments from 35 negative-sense {RNA} viruses (a total of 2154 sequences) were carried out. Powerful evidence was found for recombination, in the form of incongruent phylogenetic trees between different gene regions, in only five sequences from Hantaan virus, Mumps virus and Newcastle disease virus. This is the first report of recombination in these viruses. More tentative evidence for recombination, where conflicting phylogenetic trees were observed (but were without strong bootstrap support) and/or where putative recombinant regions were very short, was found in three alignments from La Crosse virus and Puumala virus. Finally, patterns of sequence variation compatible with the action of recombination, but not definitive evidence for this process, were observed in a further ten viruses: Canine distemper virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Influenza A virus, Influenza B virus, Influenza C virus, Lassa virus, Pirital virus, Rabies virus, Rift Valley Fever virus and Vesicular stomatitis virus. The possibility of recombination in these viruses should be investigated further. Overall, this study reveals that rates of homologous recombination in negative-sense {RNA} viruses are very much lower than those of mutation, with many viruses seemingly clonal on current data. Consequently, recombination rate is unlikely to be a trait that is set by natural selection to create advantageous or purge deleterious mutations.},

	Abstract = {A theoretical investigation has been made of the influence of population size (N) and recombination fraction (c) on linkage disequilibrium (D) between a pair of loci. Two situations were studied: (i) where both loci had no effect on fitness and (ii) where they showed heterozygote superiority, but no epistacy.If the populations are initially in linkage equilibrium, then the mean value {ofD} remains zero with inbreeding, but the mean {ofD} (2) increases to a maximum value and decreases until fixation is reached at both loci. The tighter the linkage and the greater the selection, then the later is the maximum in the mean {ofD} (2) reached, and the larger its value. The correlation of gene frequencies,r, in the population of gametes within segregating lines was also studied. It was found that, for a range of selection intensities and initial gene frequencies, the mean value ofr (2) was determined almost entirely {byN} c and time, measured proportional {toN}.The implication of these results on observations of linkage disequilibrium in natural populations is discussed.},

	Abstract = {A new statistical method for estimating divergence dates of species from {DNA} sequence data by a molecular clock approach is developed. This method takes into account effectively the information contained in a set of {DNA} sequence data. The molecular clock of mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtDNA)} was calibrated by setting the date of divergence between primates and ungulates at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (65 million years ago), when the extinction of dinosaurs occurred. A generalized leastsquares method was applied in fitting a model to {mtDNA} sequence data, and the clock gave dates of 92.3$\pm$11.7, 13.3$\pm$1.5, 10.9$\pm$1.2, 3.7$\pm$0.6, and 2.7$\pm$0.6 million years ago (where the second of each pair of numbers is the standard deviation) for the separation of mouse, gibbon, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee, respectively, from the line leading to humans. Although there is some uncertainty in the clock, this dating may pose a problem for the widely believed hypothesis that the bipedal {creatureAustralopithecus} afarensis, which lived some 3.7 million years ago at Laetoli in Tanzania and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was ancestral to man and evolved after the human-ape splitting. Another likelier possibility is that {mtDNA} was transferred through hybridization between a proto-human and a protochimpanzee after the former had developed bipedalism.},

Our method can be applied to arbitrarily complex models as the likelihood is estimated by coalescent simulations. Under simple scenarios, our method behaves similarly to a widely used diffusion-based method while showing better convergence properties. In addition, our approach can be applied to very complex models including as many as a dozen populations, and still retrieve parameters very accurately in a reasonable time. We apply our approach to estimate the past demography of four human populations for which non-coding whole genome diversity is available, estimating the degree of European admixture of a southwest African American population and that of a Kenyan population with an unsampled East African population. We also show the versatility of our framework by inferring the demographic history of African populations from {SNP} chip data with known ascertainment bias, and find a very old divergence time ({\textgreater}110 Ky) between Yorubas from Western Africa and Sans from Southern Africa.},

	Abstract = {Researchers routinely estimate distances between molecular sequences using continuous-time Markov chain models. We present a new method, robust counting, that protects against the possibly severe bias arising from model misspecification. We achieve this robustness by generalizing the conventional distance estimation to incorporate the empirical distribution of site patterns found in the observed pairwise sequence alignment. Our flexible framework allows for computing distances based only on a subset of possible substitutions. From this, we show how to estimate labeled codon distances, such as expected numbers of synonymous or nonsynonymous substitutions. We present two simulation studies. The first compares the relative bias and variance of conventional and robust labeled nucleotide estimators. In the second simulation, we demonstrate that robust counting furnishes accurate synonymous and nonsynonymous distance estimates based only on easy-to-fit models of nucleotide substitution, bypassing the need for computationally expensive codon models. We conclude with three empirical examples. In the first two examples, we investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the influenza A hemagglutinin gene using labeled codon distances. In the final example, we demonstrate the advantages of using robust synonymous distances to alleviate the effect of convergent evolution on phylogenetic analysis of an {HIV} transmission network.},

	Abstract = {We describe a model-based method for using multilocus sequence data to infer the clonal relationships of bacteria and the chromosomal position of homologous recombination events that disrupt a clonal pattern of inheritance. The key assumption of our model is that recombination events introduce a constant rate of substitutions to a contiguous region of sequence. The method is applicable both to multilocus sequence typing ({MLST}) data from a few loci and to alignments of multiple bacterial genomes. It can be used to decide whether a subset of isolates share common ancestry, to estimate the age of the common ancestor, and hence to address a variety of epidemiological and ecological questions that hinge on the pattern of bacterial spread. It should also be useful in associating particular genetic events with the changes in phenotype that they cause. We show that the model outperforms existing methods of subdividing recombinogenic bacteria using {MLST} data and provide examples from Salmonella and Bacillus.

@article{guindon_2003,
	Abstract = {The increase in the number of large data sets and the complexity of current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a new approach, based on the maximum-likelihood principle, which clearly satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is a simple hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch lengths simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an initial tree built by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve its likelihood at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment of the topology and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient to reach an optimum. We used extensive and realistic computer simulations to show that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high as that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches. The reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min were required on a standard personal computer to analyze a data set consisting of 500 rbc L sequences with 1,428 base pairs from plant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the same order as some popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms. This new method is implemented in the {PHYML} program, which is freely available on our web page: http://www.lirmm.fr/w3ifa/{MAAS}/.},

	Abstract = {Recent developments in marginal likelihood estimation for model selection in the field of Bayesian phylogenetics and molecular evolution have emphasized the poor performance of the harmonic mean estimator ({HME}). Although these studies have shown the merits of new approaches applied to standard normally distributed examples and small real-world data sets, not much is currently known concerning the performance and computational issues of these methods when fitting complex evolutionary and population genetic models to empirical real-world data sets. Further, these approaches have not yet seen widespread application in the field due to the lack of implementations of these computationally demanding techniques in commonly used phylogenetic packages. We here investigate the performance of some of these new marginal likelihood estimators, specifically, path sampling ({PS}) and stepping-stone ({SS}) sampling for comparing models of demographic change and relaxed molecular clocks, using synthetic data and real-world examples for which unexpected inferences were made using the {HME}. Given the drastically increased computational demands of {PS} and {SS} sampling, we also investigate a posterior simulation-based analogue of Akaike's information criterion ({AIC}) through Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}), a model comparison approach that shares with the {HME} the appealing feature of having a low computational overhead over the original {MCMC} analysis. We confirm that the {HME} systematically overestimates the marginal likelihood and fails to yield reliable model classification and show that the {AICM} performs better and may be a useful initial evaluation of model choice but that it is also, to a lesser degree, unreliable. We show that {PS} and {SS} sampling substantially outperform these estimators and adjust the conclusions made concerning previous analyses for the three real-world data sets that we reanalyzed. The methods used in this article are now available in {BEAST}, a powerful user-friendly software package to perform Bayesian evolutionary analyses.},

@article{yang_1994,
	Abstract = {Two approximate methods are proposed for maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation, which allow variable rates of substitution across nucleotide sites. Three data sets with quite different characteristics were analyzed to examine empirically the performance of these methods. The first, called the ``discrete gamma model,'' uses several categories of rates to approximate the gamma distribution, with equal probability for each category. The mean of each category is used to represent all the rates falling in the category. The performance of this method is found to be quite good, and four such categories appear to be sufficient to produce both an optimum, or near-optimum fit by the model to the data, and also an acceptable approximation to the continuous distribution. The second method, called ``fixed-rates model,'' classifies sites into several classes according to their rates predicted assuming the star tree. Sites in different classes are then assumed to be evolving at these fixed rates when other tree topologies are evaluated. Analyses of the data sets suggest that this method can produce reasonable results, but it seems to share some properties of a least-squares pairwise comparison; for example, interior branch lengths in nonbest trees are often found to be zero. The computational requirements of the two methods are comparable to that of Felsenstein's (1981, J Mol Evol 17:368--376) model, which assumes a single rate for all the sites.},

	Abstract = {Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) is a novel betacoronavirus that has been circulating in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012 and causing severe respiratory infections in humans. While bats were suggested to be involved in human {MERS}-{CoV} infections, a direct link between bats and {MERS}-{CoV} is uncertain. On the other hand, serological and virological data suggest dromedary camels as the potential animal reservoirs of {MERS}-{CoV}. Recently, we isolated {MERS}-{CoV} from a camel and its infected owner and provided evidence for the direct transmission of {MERS}-{CoV} from the infected camel to the patient. Here, we extend this work and show that identical {MERS}-{CoV} {RNA} fragments were detected in an air sample collected from the same barn that sheltered the infected camel in our previous study. These data indicate that the virus was circulating in this farm concurrently with its detection in the camel and in the patient, which warrants further investigations for the possible airborne transmission of {MERS}-{CoV}.
{IMPORTANCE} This work clearly highlights the importance of continuous surveillance and infection control measures to control the global public threat of {MERS}-{CoV}. While current {MERS}-{CoV} transmission appears to be limited, we advise minimal contact with camels, especially for immunocompromised individuals, and the use of appropriate health, safety, and infection prevention and control measures when dealing with infected patients. Also, detailed clinical histories of any {MERS}-{CoV} cases with epidemiological and laboratory investigations carried out for any animal exposure must be considered to identify any animal source.},

	Abstract = {Complete Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) genome sequences were obtained from nasal swabs of dromedary camels sampled in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia through direct analysis of nucleic acid extracts or following virus isolation in cell culture. Consensus dromedary {MERS}-{CoV} genome sequences were the same with either template source and identical to published human {MERS}-{CoV} sequences. However, in contrast to individual human cases, where only clonal genomic sequences are reported, detailed population analyses revealed the presence of more than one genomic variant in individual dromedaries. If humans are truly infected only with clonal virus populations, we must entertain a model for interspecies transmission of {MERS}-{CoV} wherein only specific genotypes are capable of passing bottleneck selection.
{IMPORTANCE} In most cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome ({MERS}), the route for human infection with the causative agent, {MERS} coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}), is unknown. Antibodies to and viral nucleic acids of {MERS}-{CoV} have been found in dromedaries, suggesting the possibility that they may serve as a reservoir or vector for human infection. However, neither whole viral genomic sequence nor infectious virus has been isolated from dromedaries or other animals in Saudi Arabia. Here, we report recovery of {MERS}-{CoV} from nasal swabs of dromedaries, demonstrate that {MERS}-{CoV} whole-genome consensus sequences from dromedaries and humans are indistinguishable, and show that dromedaries can be simultaneously infected with more than one {MERS}-{CoV}. Together with data indicating widespread dromedary infection in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, these findings support the plausibility of a role for dromedaries in human infection.},

	Abstract = {The composite-likelihood estimator ({CLE}) of the population recombination rate considers only sites with exactly two alleles under a finite-sites mutation model (. A coalescent-based method for detecting and estimating recombination from gene sequences. Genetics 160:1231--1241). While in such a model the identity of alleles is not considered, the {CLE} has been shown to be robust to minor misspecification of the underlying mutational model. However, there are many situations where the putative mutation and demographic history can be quite complex. One good example is rapidly evolving pathogens, like {HIV}-1. First we evaluated the performance of the {CLE} and the likelihood permutation test ({LPT}) under more complex, realistic models, including a general time reversible ({GTR}) substitution model, rate heterogeneity among sites (Γ), positive selection, population growth, population structure, and noncontemporaneous sampling. Second, we relaxed some of the assumptions of the {CLE} allowing for a four-allele, {GTR} + Γ model in an attempt to use the data more efficiently. Through simulations and the analysis of real data, we concluded that the {CLE} is robust to severe misspecifications of the substitution model, but underestimates the recombination rate in the presence of exponential growth, population mixture, selection, or noncontemporaneous sampling. In such cases, the use of more complex models slightly increases performance in some occasions, especially in the case of the {LPT}. Thus, our results provide for a more robust application of the estimation of recombination rates.},

@article{corman_rooting_2014,
	Abstract = {The emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) causes lethal respiratory infections mainly on the Arabian Peninsula. The evolutionary origins of {MERS}-{CoV} are unknown. We determined the full genome sequence of a {CoV} directly from fecal material obtained from a South African Neoromicia capensis bat ({NeoCoV}). {NeoCoV} shared essential details of genome architecture with {MERS}-{CoV}. Eighty-five percent of the {NeoCoV} genome was identical to {MERS}-{CoV} at the nucleotide level. Based on taxonomic criteria, {NeoCoV} and {MERS}-{CoV} belonged to one viral species. The presence of a genetically divergent S1 subunit within the {NeoCoV} spike gene indicated that intraspike recombination events may have been involved in the emergence of {MERS}-{CoV}. {NeoCoV} constitutes a sister taxon of {MERS}-{CoV}, placing the {MERS}-{CoV} root between a recently described virus from African camels and all other viruses. This suggests a higher level of viral diversity in camels than in humans. Together with serologic evidence for widespread {MERS}-{CoV} infection in camelids sampled up to 20 years ago in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, the genetic data indicate that camels act as sources of virus for humans rather than vice versa. The majority of camels on the Arabian Peninsula is imported from the Greater Horn of Africa, where several Neoromicia species occur. The acquisition of {MERS}-{CoV} by camels from bats might have taken place in sub-Saharan Africa. Camelids may represent mixing vessels for {MERS}-{CoV} and other mammalian {CoVs}.
{IMPORTANCE} It is unclear how, when, and where the highly pathogenic {MERS}-{CoV} emerged. We characterized the full genome of an African bat virus closely related to {MERS}-{CoV} and show that human, camel, and bat viruses belong to the same viral species. The bat virus roots the phylogenetic tree of {MERS}-{CoV}, providing evidence for an evolution of {MERS}-{CoV} in camels that preceded that in humans. The revised tree suggests that humans are infected by camels rather than vice versa. Although {MERS}-{CoV} cases occur mainly on the Arabian Peninsula, the data from this study together with serologic and molecular investigations of African camels indicate that the initial host switch from bats may have taken place in Africa. The emergence of {MERS}-{CoV} likely involved exchanges of genetic elements between different viral ancestors. These exchanges may have taken place either in bat ancestors or in camels acting as mixing vessels for viruses from different hosts.},

	Abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
Since June, 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV}) has, worldwide, caused 104 infections in people including 49 deaths, with 82 cases and 41 deaths reported from Saudi Arabia. In addition to confirming diagnosis, we generated the {MERS}-{CoV} genomic sequences obtained directly from patient samples to provide important information on {MERS}-{CoV} transmission, evolution, and origin.
Methods
Full genome deep sequencing was done on nucleic acid extracted directly from {PCR}-confirmed clinical samples. Viral genomes were obtained from 21 {MERS} cases of which 13 had 100\%, four 85--95\%, and four 30--50\% genome coverage. Phylogenetic analysis of the 21 sequences, combined with nine published {MERS}-{CoV} genomes, was done.
Findings
Three distinct {MERS}-{CoV} genotypes were identified in Riyadh. Phylogeographic analyses suggest the {MERS}-{CoV} zoonotic reservoir is geographically disperse. Selection analysis of the {MERS}-{CoV} genomes reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the S protein. The genetic diversity in the Al-Hasa cluster suggests that the hospital outbreak might have had more than one virus introduction.
Interpretation
We present the largest number of {MERS}-{CoV} genomes (21) described so far. {MERS}-{CoV} full genome sequences provide greater detail in tracking transmission. Multiple introductions of {MERS}-{CoV} are identified and suggest lower R0 values. Transmission within Saudi Arabia is consistent with either movement of an animal reservoir, animal products, or movement of infected people. Further definition of the exposures responsible for the sporadic introductions of {MERS}-{CoV} into human populations is urgently needed.

	Abstract = {Background. In spring 2014, a sudden rise in the number of notified {MERS}-Coronavirus infections occurred across Saudi Arabia with a focus in Jeddah. Hypotheses to explain the outbreak pattern include increased surveillance, increased zoonotic transmission, nosocomial transmission, changes in viral transmissibility, as well as diagnostic laboratory artifacts.
Methods. Diagnostic results from Jeddah Regional Laboratory were analyzed. Viruses from the Jeddah outbreak and viruses occurring during the same time in Riyadh, Al-Kharj, and Madinah were fully or partially sequenced. A set of four single nucleotide polymorphisms distinctive to the Jeddah outbreak were determined from additional viruses. Viruses from Riyadh and Jeddah were isolated and studied in cell culture.
Results and conclusions. Up to 481 samples were received per day for {RT}-{PCR} testing. A laboratory proficiency assessment suggested positive and negative results to be reliable. Forty-nine percent of 168 positive-testing samples during the Jeddah outbreak stemmed from King Fahd Hospital. All viruses from Jeddah were monophyletic and similar, while viruses from Riyadh were paraphyletic and diverse. A hospital-associated transmission cluster, to which cases in Indiana/{USA} and the Netherlands belonged, was discovered in Riyadh. One Jeddah-type virus was found in Riyadh, with matching travel history to Jeddah. Virus isolates representing outbreaks in Jeddah and Riyadh were not different from {MERS}-{CoV} {EMC}/2012 in replication, escape of interferon response, and serum neutralization. Detection rates and average virus concentrations did not change significantly over the outbreak in Jeddah. These results suggest the outbreaks to have been caused by biologically unchanged viruses in connection with nosocomial transmission.},

	Abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer is an important driver of bacterial evolution, but genetic exchange in the core genome of clonal species, including the major pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, is incompletely understood. Here we reveal widespread homologous recombination in S. aureus at the species level, in contrast to its near-complete absence between closely related strains. We discover a patchwork of hotspots and coldspots at fine scales falling against a backdrop of broad-scale trends in rate variation. Over megabases, homoplasy rates fluctuate 1.9-fold, peaking towards the origin-of-replication. Over kilobases, we find core recombination hotspots of up to 2.5-fold enrichment situated near fault lines in the genome associated with mobile elements. The strongest hotspots include regions flanking conjugative transposon {ICE}6013, the staphylococcal cassette chromosome ({SCC}) and genomic island νSaα. Mobile element-driven core genome transfer represents an opportunity for adaptation and challenges our understanding of the recombination landscape in predominantly clonal pathogens, with important implications for genotype--phenotype mapping.},

	Abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that the type {II} feline coronavirus ({FCoV}) strains 79-1146 and 79-1683 have arisen from a homologous {RNA} recombination event between {FCoV} type I and canine coronavirus ({CCV}). In both cases, the template switch apparently took place between the S and M genes, giving rise to recombinant viruses which encode a {CCV}-like S protein and the M, N, 7a, and 7b proteins of {FCoV} type I (K. Motowaka, T. Hoh- datsu, H. Hashimoto, and H. Koyama, Microbiol. Immunol. 40:425--433, 1996; H. Vennema, A. Poland, K. Floyd Hawkins, and N. C. Pedersen, Feline Pract. 23:40--44, 1995). In the present study, we have looked for additional {FCoV}-{CCV} recombination sites. Four regions in the pol gene were selected for comparative sequence analysis of the type {II} {FCoV} strains 79-1683 and 79-1146, the type I {FCoV} strains {TN}406 and {UCD}1, the {CCV} strain K378, and the {TGEV} strain Purdue. Our data show that the type {II} {FCoVs} have arisen from double recombination events: additional crossover sites were mapped in the {ORF}1ab frameshifting region of strain 79-1683 and in the 5′ half of {ORF}1b of strain 79-1146.},

@article{holmes_1999,
	Abstract = {The extent to which recombination disrupts the bifurcating treelike phylogeny and clonal structure imposed by binary fission on bacterial populations remains contentious. Here, we address this question with a study of nucleotide sequence data from 107 isolates of the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. Gene fragments from 12 house-keeping loci distributed around the meningococcal chromosome were analyzed, showing that (1) identical alleles are disseminated among genetically diverse isolates, with no evidence for linkage disequilibrium; (2) different loci give distinct and incongruent phylogenetic trees; and (3) allele sequences are incompatible with a bifurcating treelike phylogeny at all loci. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that meningococcal populations comprise organisms assembled from a common gene pool, with alleles and allele fragments spreading independently, together with the occasional importation of genetic material from other species. Further, they support the view that recombination is an important genetic mechanism in the generation new meningococcal clones and alleles. Consequently, for anything other than the short-term evolution of this species, a bifurcating treelike phylogeny is not an appropriate model.},

	Abstract = {{RNA}-{RNA} recombination between different strains of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus ({MHV}) occurs at a very high frequency in tissue culture. To demonstrate that {RNA} recombination may play a role in the evolution and pathogenesis of coronaviruses, we sought to determine whether {MHV} recombination could occur during replication in the animal host of the virus. By using two selectable markers, i.e., temperature sensitivity and monoclonal antibody neutralization, we isolated several recombinant viruses from the brains of mice infected with two different strains of {MHV}. The recombination frequency was very high, and recombination occurred at multiple sites on the viral {RNA} genome. This finding suggests that {RNA}-{RNA} recombination may play a significant role in natural evolution and neuropathogenesis of coronaviruses.},

@article{pond_2006,
	Abstract = {The evolution of homologous sequences affected by recombination or gene conversion cannot be adequately explained by a single phylogenetic tree. Many tree-based methods for sequence analysis, for example, those used for detecting sites evolving nonneutrally, have been shown to fail if such phylogenetic incongruity is ignored. However, it may be possible to propose several phylogenies that can correctly model the evolution of nonrecombinant fragments. We propose a model-based framework that uses a genetic algorithm to search a multiple-sequence alignment for putative recombination break points, quantifies the level of support for their locations, and identifies sequences or clades involved in putative recombination events. The software implementation can be run quickly and efficiently in a distributed computing environment, and various components of the methods can be chosen for computational expediency or statistical rigor. We evaluate the performance of the new method on simulated alignments and on an array of published benchmark data sets. Finally, we demonstrate that prescreening alignments with our method allows one to analyze recombinant sequences for positive selection.},

	Abstract = {Embryonated eggs were coinfected with two strains of the coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus ({IBV}), {IBV}-Beaudette and {IBV}-M41, to investigate whether recombination between the two strains would occur. Virions were isolated from the allantoic fluid of the coinfected eggs and putative hybrid {RNAs} were detected by polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}), using strain-specific oligonucleotides. {PCR} products, of the expected sizes, were obtained as predicted from potential recombination events between the nucleoprotein (N) gene and the 3′-untranslated region of the two {IBV} genomes. Sequencing confirmed that they corresponded to hybrid {RNAs}. Virus produced as a result of the mixed infection was treated with an M41-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody and passaged in Vero cells, in which {IBV}-Beaudette, but not {IBV}-M41, replicated. Hybrid {RNA} was still detectable after three serial passages. Since no {IBV}-M41 was detectable this confirmed that infectious recombinant genomes had been produced in the embryonated eggs. These findings not only support the circumstantial evidence, from sequencing studies of {IBV} field strains, that recombination occurs during replication of {IBV} and contributes to the diversity of {IBV}, but also show that coronavirus {RNA} recombination is not limited to mouse hepatitis virus.},

	Abstract = {We have isolated a recombinant virus between the A59 and {JHM} strains of mouse hepatitis virus, which contain a single species of nonsegmented {RNA} genome. This recombinant was derived by mixed infection of {DBT} cells with temperature-sensitive mutants of A59 and {JHM} at nonpermissive temperature. Viruses recovered at this temperature were screened by oligonucleotide fingerprinting of their genomic {RNAs}. One recombinant virus, B1, was found to contain mostly A59-derived sequences, but the 3 kilobases at the 5' end of the genomic {RNA} was derived from {JHM}. Thus, the crossover point in the B1 genome is located within gene A, which codes for the viral {RNA} polymerases. The study of the intracellular {RNA} species of B1 virus revealed that probably all of the virus-specific subgenomic {mRNA} species contained the body sequences of strain A59 but the leader sequences of {JHM}. This result indicates that the {JHM} leader {RNA}, which differs from the A59 leader {RNA}, could be fused to the {mRNAs} of a different virus strain during {RNA} transcription. Furthermore, B1 virus-infected cells contain an additional subgenomic {mRNA} species which is transcribed from a new initiation site within gene C, suggesting that the leader {RNA} could determine the site of initiation for coronavirus {mRNAs}. These data represent a first report of {RNA} recombination between viruses, other than picornaviruses, which contain nonsegmented {RNA} genomes.},

	Abstract = {The {RNA} genome of coronaviruses consists of a single species of nonsegmented {RNA}. In this communication, we demonstrate that the {RNA} genomes of different strains of murine coronaviruses recombine during mixed infection at a very high frequency. Susceptible cells were coinfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of one strain of mouse hepatitis virus ({MHV}) and a wild-type virus of a different strain. Of 21 randomly isolated viruses released from the coinfected cells at the nonpermissive temperature, 2 were recombinants which differed in the site of recombination. After three serial passages of the original virus pool derived from the mixed infection, the majority of the progeny viruses were recombinants. These recombinant viruses represented at least five different recombination sites between the two parental {MHV} strains. Such a high-frequency recombination between nonsegmented {RNA} genomes of {MHV} suggests that segmented {RNA} intermediates might be generated during {MHV} replication. We propose that the {RNA} replication of {MHV} proceeds in a discontinuous and nonprocessive manner, thus generating free segmented {RNA} intermediates, which could be used in {RNA} recombination via a copy-choice mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Determining the amount of recombination in the genealogical history of a sample of genes is important to both evolutionary biology and medical population genetics. However, recurrent mutation can produce patterns of genetic diversity similar to those generated by recombination and can bias estimates of the population recombination rate. Hudson (2001) has suggested an approximate-likelihood method based on coalescent theory to estimate the population recombination rate, 4Ner, under an infinite-sites model of sequence evolution. Here we extend the method to the estimation of the recombination rate in genomes, such as those of many viruses and bacteria, where the rate of recurrent mutation is high. In addition, we develop a powerful permutation-based method for detecting recombination that is both more powerful than other permutation-based methods and robust to misspecification of the model of sequence evolution. We apply the method to sequence data from viruses, bacteria, and human mitochondrial {DNA}. The extremely high level of recombination detected in both {HIV}1 and {HIV}2 sequences demonstrates that recombination cannot be ignored in the analysis of viral population genetic data.},

	Abstract = {Recombination is a key evolutionary process that shapes the architecture of genomes and the genetic structure of populations. Although many statistical methods are available for the detection of recombination from {DNA} sequences, their absolute and relative performance is still unknown. Here we evaluated the performance of 14 different recombination detection algorithms. We used the coalescent with recombination to simulate {DNA} sequences with different levels of recombination, genetic diversity, and rate variation among sites. Recombination detection methods were applied to these data sets, and whether they detected or not recombination was recorded. Different recombination methods showed distinct performance depending on the amount of recombination, genetic diversity, and rate variation among sites. The model of nucleotide substitution under which the data were generated did not seem to have a significant effect. Most methods increase power with more sequence divergence. In general, recombination detection methods seem to capture the presence of recombination, but they are not very powerful. Methods that use substitution patterns or incompatibility among sites were more powerful than methods based on phylogenetic incongruence. Most methods do not seem to infer more false positives than expected by chance. Especially depending on the amount of diversity in the data, different methods could be used to attain maximum power while minimizing false positives. Results shown here will provide some guidance in the selection of the most appropriate method/s for the analysis of the particular data at hand.},

	Abstract = {{SummaryBackground}
A new betacoronavirus---Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS}-{CoV})---has been identified in patients with severe acute respiratory infection. Although related viruses infect bats, molecular clock analyses have been unable to identify direct ancestors of {MERS}-{CoV}. Anecdotal exposure histories suggest that patients had been in contact with dromedary camels or goats. We investigated possible animal reservoirs of {MERS}-{CoV} by assessing specific serum antibodies in livestock.
Methods
We took sera from animals in the Middle East (Oman) and from elsewhere (Spain, Netherlands, Chile). Cattle (n=80), sheep (n=40), goats (n=40), dromedary camels (n=155), and various other camelid species (n=34) were tested for specific serum {IgG} by protein microarray using the receptor-binding S1 subunits of spike proteins of {MERS}-{CoV}, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and human coronavirus {OC}43. Results were confirmed by virus neutralisation tests for {MERS}-{CoV} and bovine coronavirus.
Findings
50 of 50 (100\%) sera from Omani camels and 15 of 105 (14\%) from Spanish camels had protein-specific antibodies against {MERS}-{CoV} spike. Sera from European sheep, goats, cattle, and other camelids had no such antibodies. {MERS}-{CoV} neutralising antibody titres varied between 1/320 and 1/2560 for the Omani camel sera and between 1/20 and 1/320 for the Spanish camel sera. There was no evidence for cross-neutralisation by bovine coronavirus antibodies.
Interpretation
{MERS}-{CoV} or a related virus has infected camel populations. Both titres and seroprevalences in sera from different locations in Oman suggest widespread infection.

@article{smith_1998,
	Abstract = {In this article, a method is proposed for detecting recombination in the sequences of a gene from a set of closely related organisms. The method, the Homoplasy Test, is appropriate when the sequences are rather similar, differing by 1\%-5\% of nucleotides. It is effective in detecting relatively frequent recombination between a set of rather similar strains, in contrast to previous methods which detect rare or unique transfers between more distant strains. It is based on the fact that, if there is no recombination and if no repeated mutations have occurred (homoplasy), then the number of polymorphic sites, v, is equal to the number of steps, t, in a most-parsimonious tree. If the number of "apparent homoplasies" in the most-parsimonious tree, h = t-v, is greater than zero, then either homoplasies have occurred by mutation or there has been recombination. An estimate of the distribution of h expected on the null hypothesis of no recombination depends on Se, the "effective site number," defined as follows: if ps is the probability that two independent substitutions in the gene occur at the same site, then Se = 1/ps. Se can be estimated if a suitable outgroup is available. The Homoplasy Test is applied to three bacterial genes and to simulated gene trees with varying amounts of recombination. Methods of estimating the rate, as opposed to the occurrence, of recombination are discussed.},
